DMA TEST 0:
	 use a single DMA control block to write 'hello world!' to the destination.
(Before transfer) destination reads: 
successful return
(After transfer) destination reads: 'hello world!'

DMA TEST 1:
	Use 2 DMA control blocks to change the string 'uh-oh world!' to 'hello world!' and write it to the destination.
(Before transfer) destination reads: 
successful return
(After transfer) destination reads: hello world!

DMA TEST 2:
	Stop two DMA control blocks who point to each other from looping infinitely by writing 0 to one of their nextControlBlockAddr fields.
(Before transfer) destination reads: 
successful return
(After transfer) destination reads: hello world!

DMA Test 3:
	Change the bottom byte of a 'reg' without manipulating its other bits.
successful return
(After transfer) reg reads: ffffff00

DMA Test 4:
	Update the bottom byte of the PCM CS_A reg.
PCM CS_A reg is initialized as 22a6201
successful return
(After transfer) PCM CS_A reg reads 2a6000
